# TikshuvDepartment
The Tikshuv project was written in c# using ASP.NET Web API technology, (Visual Studio 2022), All the files must be downloaded and the project qualified, please note that the project needs a connection to a SQL SERVER database, therefore the file "Tabels Create.sql" is attached. Please open a new database and update the attached tables in it. It is very good to name the database "ProjetDb". This is how we will request spot changes in the project. It should be noted that in one of the attached files "appsettings.json" there is a place to insert a database connection string, therefore the name of the server and the name of the database must be replaced, After that, the project must be run, and a window will open through which you can see all the different API services, such as adding and removing from tables, various queries, everything is documented! Successfully!
Attached for the first exercise is the main.py file.
To run it, open a Python project and copy the contents of the file to main
